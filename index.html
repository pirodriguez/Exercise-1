        <h3>Some Stuff about me</h3>

        <p> Hello I am Paulo I. Rodriguez, you can call me pau.</p>

        <p> My favorite CMSC so far is idk. On the other hand, my favorite GE is ethics because I enjoyed our discussion in class, the professor asked us a lot of questions that made us think more philosophically about the mundane things in life. owo</p>

        <p>Favorite programming language is Java because idk I think because I can use it for mobile development if I would like to try to create apps or games this upcoming midyear/summer break. I would like to explore more about it if I have time and resources owo</p>

        <p>I didn't enjoy my semestral break much because my laptop's charger broke and it is still not replaced (because it cannot be repaired) and there is no wifi at home. I needed to buy load just to surf the internet. However I downloaded a rpg game and played it almost every day during the break and I enjoyed it a lot. The game was Doom and Destiny</p>

        <p>I arrived on friday before the eruption so I was affected by it. We can smell the sulfur in our room so we used blankets to cover the windows and it prevented the ash from getting inside. However, our dorm was open on the lobbies so we could smell the sulfur while walking on our lobbies. It was hard to find face mask but fortunately, I was able to buy a box for the dorm.UHO also provided us food on Monday and Tuesday so we didn't have much problem with food.</p>

        <h3>Additional Infos</h3>

        <p>My hobbies are usually sedentary. I like playing video games, watching anime, and sometimes, reading stuff. I usually play computer games rather than mobile games and one of my favorite video game is Starcraft 2.</p>

        <p>I don't know much about the tourist spots in our hometown so I'll state tourist spots in my province lol. We have a nature park thingy called eco park, of course it has a lot of trees, it's one of the spots that you might want to go to if you are a nature lover. There is also a maze there using plants however the plants were not tall enough so you can probably see the maze if you are tall. One place that you might want to visit is the Mayon Volcano, but of course don't visit it if it is active, unless you are a rescuer or a phivolcs employee. It's not a tourist spot but we have a festival during september, it is a weeklong and parades, exhibitions, and a lot of stuff occus at the plaza everyday. You might want to see all the performances of every schools who are participating.</p>

        <p>My childhood dream, and is still my dream, is to become a wizard/mage/sorcerer. In short, a magic user. Idk magic has a lot of possibilities, it is probably a very dream come true if one of the magics I can use is teleportation or at least telekinesis. Am a lazy and feeble person so being able to teleport is a big yay. Another dream of mine is to be able to fly.</p>
