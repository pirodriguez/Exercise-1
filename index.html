        <h1>Some Stuff about me</h1>

        <p> Hello I am Paulo I. Rodriguez, you can call me pau.</p>

        <p> My favorite CMSC so far is idk. On the other hand, my favorite GE is ethics because I enjoyed our discussion in class, the professor asked us a lot of questions that made us think more philosophically about the mundane things in life. owo</p>

        <p>Favorite programming language is Java because idk I think because I can use it for mobile development if I would like to try to create apps or games this upcoming midyear/summer break. I would like to explore more about it if I have time and resources owo</p>

        <p>I didn't enjoy my semestral break much because my laptop's charger broke and it is still not replaced (because it cannot be repaired) and there is no wifi at home. I needed to buy load just to surf the internet. However I downloaded a rpg game and played it almost every day during the break and I enjoyed it a lot. The game was Doom and Destiny</p>

        <p>I arrived on friday before the eruption so I was affected by it. We can smell the sulfur in our room so we used blankets to cover the windows and it prevented the ash from getting inside. However, our dorm was open on the lobbies so we could smell the sulfur while walking on our lobbies. It was hard to find face mask but fortunately, I was able to buy a box for the dorm.UHO also provided us food on Monday and Tuesday so we didn't have much problem with food.</p>
